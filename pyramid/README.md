# Pyramid

## Deployment

[Pyramid's deployment page](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid-cookbook/en/latest/deployment/deployment.html) does not explicitly endorse any WSGI, however, _waitress_ is the first one listed and it is used in their [first tutorial](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/quick_tutorial/index.html), so _waitress_ was used here as well for those reasons.
