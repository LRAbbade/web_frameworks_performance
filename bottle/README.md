# Bottle

## Deployment

Deployment has been done accordingly to the framework's instruction [here](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/deployment.html)

Bottle pre-ships with many WSGI servers, gunicorn was used to match the same WSGI used in Flask and Django, however, it is possible the other servers are more performant, specially the async ones.
